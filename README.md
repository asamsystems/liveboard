LiveBoard is urgency aware. Convenient, because urgent problems are always on top. You may have several LiveBoards running throughout your organisation there are separate role based views for each team.

The default installation of Nagios XI (as downloaded from nagios.com/downloads/nagios-xi) will meet the requirements needed for LiveBoard to work.  
Download the install script from github.  
Steps to get LiveBoard to work:  
- Start a terminal on the Nagios/Thruk/Naemon server
- Login as root (sudo may not work)
- Download script install_liveboard.pl `wget github.com/asamsystems/liveboard/raw/master/install_liveboard.pl`
- Run script with command: `perl install_liveboard.pl`

The script will guide you through the installation process. It will even download the liveboard docker image for you...
